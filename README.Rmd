# mvpart

mvpart fits multivariate regression trees.

This is a fork of the last archived version of mvpart on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/mvpart/).

I have edited the namespace so that it installs on R version 3.6.

## Installation

You can install the mvpart from from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("richardjtelford/mvpart")
```
