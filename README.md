mvpart
======

mvpart fits multivariate regression trees.

This is a fork of the last archived version of mvpart on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/mvpart/).

I have edited the namespace so that it installs on R version 4.5.1.

Installation
------------

You can install the mvpart from from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("maitra/mvpart")
```
